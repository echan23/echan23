Hey there, I'm Edward, a Computer Science major at the University of Maryland, College Park.
I’m interested in building scalable backend systems, real-time applications, and AI-powered tools.

My Favorite Projects:

InterviewLab.dev - A CoderPad-style platform with GPT-4o support for code hints and real-time collaboration.
Technologies: Go, Python, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS ECS, WebSockets

TerpBites.net - A full-stack web app that provides real-time nutritional data from UMD Dining Services.
Technologies: React, Flask, AWS Lambda, MySQL (RDS), BeautifulSoup

And more to come!

Currently Learning:

LLMOps & RAG systems — fine-tuning, orchestration, and evaluation with PyTorch, LangChain, and vector stores
Distributed systems — building scalable infrastructure
Neural indexing & retrieval — embedding models and vector search for smarter queries
